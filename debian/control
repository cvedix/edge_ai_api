Description: Edge AI API Server - ALL-IN-ONE Package
 Edge AI API Server provides a RESTful control plane for managing
 CVEDIX Edge AI SDK instances remotely. It allows backend services
 or remote operators to configure, launch, and monitor real-time
 computer vision instances on edge devices without direct access.

  - CVEDIX SDK runtime (bundled)
  - OpenCV libraries (bundled)
  - GStreamer libraries and plugins (bundled)
  - FFmpeg libraries (bundled)
  - All other dependencies (bundled)
 .
 No additional dependencies need to be installed. The package is
 self-contained and can be installed on any Ubuntu/Debian system
 with only basic system libraries (libc6, libstdc++6, libgcc-s1).
 .
 Features:
  - RESTful API for instance management
  - WebSocket support for real-time monitoring
  - Swagger UI for API exploration
  - Systemd service integration
  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - All dependencies bundled (no external dependencies required)
